# devlog

In order to continue maintaining transparency in terms of development, I/we will be logging any and all major (and minor) development changes here.

I've recently picked the development of the IOS app back up (actually I didn't as I started from scratch). Android will come later down the line.

The app is extremely simple, it's almost like a web-browser as you're basically just viewing the website on a mobile device. There's nothing to hide. There are however, a few perks that the app will have that aren't accessible on the desktop version ;)
